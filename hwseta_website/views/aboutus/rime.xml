												<h2>Overview and Functions of RIME Division</h2>
												<p>The Research Information Monitoring and Evaluation (RIME)
													Division plays a pivotal role in managing knowledge
													generation, as well as packaging and presenting it in a way
													that influences policy and projects in the FASSET.
												</p>
												<p>The division is also charged with the responsibility to
													monitor and evaluate implemented skills development
													projects and programmes and to find causal links to
													positive impacts of these skills development projects. In
													short, the RIME division:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>commissions and internally conducts sector specific
														research on areas to enrich the existing body of knowledge
														on skills development practices</li>
													<li>track and report on progress made by learners on
														learning programmes, their perceptions of the programme as
														they experience it and problems encountered. With this
														information, RIME makes judgements whether the desired
														impact will be made</li>
													<li>monitors and reports on the training activities of
														constituent training providers in relation to quality
														provision, objectives of the training programme and
														transfer of knowledge to learners</li>
													<li>monitors the usage of training (skills development)
														grants given to employers</li>
												</ul>
												<p>In performing its functions, an ETQA Body:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>shall abide by regulations 2 to 12 of the National
														Standards Bodies Regulations (R452 of 28 March 1998,
														Government Gazette No 18787);
													</li>
													<li>may delegate selected functions contemplated in
														subregulation (1) to a constituent provider or other body
														with the prior approval of the Authority, but may not
														delegate its accountability to the Authority; and
													</li>
													<li>if established under another Act of Parliament to
														govern a single coordinated system of multi-qualification
														providers, shall delegate the function of registering
														constituent assessors, contemplated in subregulation
														(1)(e), to its providers if their quality management
														system includes the monitoring of this function and the
														South African Qualifications Authority is notified.</li>
